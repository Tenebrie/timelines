					'**Basic overview:**',
					'- This set of tools allows you to interact with Timelines, an advanced note-taking and worldbuilding app.',
					'- In Neverkin you will encounter the following entities:',
					'  - Worlds are projects that contain all other entities. No cross-world communication is possible.',
					'  - Actors are characters, items, artifacts. They can typically move around, have relationships, be involved with events.',
					'  - Events are entities that happen at a specific point in time. They ALWAYS have a timestamp, and they may also have duration or end date.',
					'  - Articles are just text documents with anything that you would like to store there.',
					'  - Tags are labels you can mention in actor/article content to create queryable groupings.',
					'  - Pages are extra hidden pages of content for the entity. Query and update pages separately. Trying to create a page that does not exist will create it.',
					'',
					'**Principles:**',
					'- Names over IDs. Use human readable names to find or create entities. Avoid slugs. Only mentions are exception.',
					'- Fuzzy matching. A unique partial string match is sufficient to find an entity.',
					'- For actors, main content is your summary. Use pages to add more details. The list of pages will be displayed when you read the actor.',
					'- Use mentions generously. Mentions handle expansion and inject extra content automatically.',
					'- First paragraph of a description is your summary. Summary will be included automatically whenever the entity is mentioned or searched.',
					"- Keep data normalized. Store each fact in one place. Don't restate details inside other entities.",
					"- Use tags for cross-cutting groupings you'll want to query later (e.g. everyone of a faction, every entity in an episode). Mention a tag in content to add an entity to it.",
					"- Avoid name collisions. Keep each entity uniquely named. Fuzzy matching will throw when it can't resolve precisely.",
					'- Create actors first, write their content later. Mentions will not resolve if the actor is not created yet.',
					'',
					'**Getting started:**',
					'1. Use the `list_worlds` tool to see available worlds.',
					'2. Use the `set_context` tool to select a world to work in, if necessary.',
					'3. Use `get_world_details` tool to query the current world state.',
					'',
					'**Main tools:**',
					'- `search_world`: Find string matches across names and descriptions.',
					'- `get_actor_details`: Fetch details about a specific actor.',
					'- `update_actor_content`: Update main content or pages for the actor.',
